# Space-Invaders-Game
Classic Space-Invaders game written in Java OOP.

This implementation of the classic Space-Invaders game was written in Java as a project in
the Object-Oriented course I took at Bar Ilan University. 

The game has a starting menu, Highscore table and 5 level sets which you can enjoy,
